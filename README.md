ghiraldi-base-admin
========================

This admin plugin is part of the ghiraldi base of plugins.  This adds the generic
concept of an administrative section of a ghiraldi app.  The plugin by itself
isn't necessarily useful, but is designed to serve as a base for other administrative
plugins and functions. It defines the entry point into an admin interface and 
basic access controls.

Depends on ghiraldi-base-user and ghiraldi-base-role plugins.
